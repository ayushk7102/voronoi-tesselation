# voronoi-tessellation
A Voronoi tessellation is a partition of a plane into regions, or cells, close to each of a given set of points. This mathematical principle has many applications in biology, epidemiology, and even flight navigation. 

This repo contains a few of my own implementations of algorithms to partition a plane into convex Voronoi cells.
